# Test Case for Frontend Developer position at OLX


## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to interview with OLX. We’d like you to have a look at the following task.
We’re interested in seeing how you approach the task. The case is very important because it gives you a preview of the type of challenges you will be working on if you were to join us. It is important for us as well, because in this way we will be able to hire the best talent out there.

Go ahead, give it your best shot and if you have any questions please send them
to your recruiting contact.

Good luck!


## Before you start


### Version control and commit often

Usage of a version control is a best practice in any software project. Therefore
we definitely recommend you to use one. We recommend frequent small
commits; not only will it allow you to have meaningful checkpoint as
you make your way through the case. Another reason is that it can be decisive in
our choice of the best solution.


**Important Note:** please do not publish your project to a public version control system (e.g. github.com)


### Coding style and comments

Just like the previous point on commits, coding style and comments are important
as they can be decisive in our choice when comparing functionally equivalent
solutions. Do your best, provide meaningful comments when needed and use
idiomatic language constructs.


### Provided files

There are 4 files under `files/`:

* `frontned_challenge.pdf` - This is the design you have to implement.

* `visual_system_guide.pdf` - This is the visual guide you have to follow.
  
* `data.json` - This is the data to display.

* `regions.json` - List of regions in the system.


### Bonus points


* **Readme.md** in your project explaining how to run the project.

* Usage of automatic linting and code-formatting tools.



### How to return the Case ?

Send us your project directory (a `--bare` version would be appreciated) in a zip
file.


## Enough talking, let's dive in!

The task is simple - have a functional page. You have the freedom to choose which features to implement fully and which to leave only as placeholders.


### Requirements

Our technology stack consist of VueJS and TypeScript. Of course, a solution using these technologies is preferred, but you can use any language/SDK you are comfortable with.

We are interested in the "Experiments" page, but a functioning router with dummy pages is required.

* https://v2.vuejs.org/

### Bonus exercises

Our goal is to have developers who understand how our systems interact between each other and can support the full lifecycle of the product. These additional tasks are **not required** but they can make a difference:

* Usage of a container technology (e.g. Docker).

* Sample `gitlab-ci.yaml` file for Gitlab CI/CD integration (or similar CI/CD provider).

* Integration tests - basic setup is enough.
